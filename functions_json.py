"Support and resistance levels are key concepts in technical analysis, representing price points on a chart where the odds favor a pause or reversal of a prevailing trend. \
This function analyzes candlestick charts over a specified timeframe and lookback period to calculate these levels and their respective strengths. \
Returns a dictionary containing four lists, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the calculated support and resistance levels: \
1. levels_prices (list of floats): The prices at which support and resistance levels have been identified. \
2. levels_start_timestamps (list of timestamps): The starting timestamps for each identified level, indicating when the level first became relevant. \
3. levels_end_timestamps (list of timestamps): The ending timestamps for each level, marking when the level was last relevant. \
4. levels_scores (list of floats): Scores associated with each level, indicating the strength or significance of the level. Higher scores typically imply stronger levels.",
