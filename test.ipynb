Support and Resistance Calculation: I can calculate support and resistance levels for a financial instrument based on candlestick charts. These levels represent price points where the odds favor a pause or reversal of a prevailing trend. You will receive a list of support and resistance levels, along with their strengths.\\n\\n3. Stop Loss Calculation: I can calculate the stop loss (SL) for a trade based on different methods such as swing, minmax, ATR, and more. The stop loss helps limit potential losses in a position. You will receive the calculated stop loss value, the risk on the trade, and additional information about the method used.\\n\\n4. Take Profit Calculation: I can calculate the take profit (TP) levels for a trade. Take profit represents the price level at which a trader aims to close a position to secure profits before the market reverses. You will receive a list of take profit prices and information about each price.\\n\\n5. Bias Detection: I can detect the trading bias for a financial instrument using various methods such as trend detection, moving averages, volume profile, and more. The bias detection helps determine the appropriate entry point for a long or short trade.
