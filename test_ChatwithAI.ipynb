The algorithm takes inspiration from the behavior of bees in nature to perform both local and global search to find optimal solutions. It involves sending scout bees to search for initial solutions, evaluating and rearranging these solutions based on their costs, and then iterating through multiple repetitions to refine the solutions by generating new ones around elite and non-elite sites. The process continues until the maximum number of iterations is reached, resulting in an optimal solution. The file emphasizes that the Beez algorithm guarantees convergence and can be applied to various optimization problems.\n",
