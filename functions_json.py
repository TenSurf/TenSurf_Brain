This function analyzes candlestick charts over a specified timeframe and lookback period to calculate these levels and their respective strengths. \
Returns a dictionary containing four lists, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the calculated support and resistance levels: \
1. levels_prices (list of floats): The prices at which support and resistance levels have been identified. \
2. levels_start_timestamps (list of timestamps): The starting timestamps for each identified level, indicating when the level first became relevant. \
3. levels_end_timestamps (list of timestamps): The ending timestamps for each level, marking when the level was last relevant. \
4. levels_scores (list of floats): Scores associated with each level, indicating the strength or significance of the level. Higher scores typically imply stronger levels.",

    ######### Stop Loss Calculation #########
    {
        "name": "calculate_sl",
        "description": '''Identifying the optimal level for placing a stop-loss. \
Here is a detailed explanation for each stop-loss (SL) suggestion method, considering the distinction between long and short positions: \
1. **Swing Method**:In the Swing Method, the stop-loss (SL) calculation is based on recent high swings for short positions and low swings for long positions. The determination of these swings is influenced by the 'neighborhood' parameter, which specifies the range or proximity within which the swings are identified. Adjusting the 'neighborhood' parameter can impact how the swings are detected and consequently affect the SL levels suggested by this method. \
2. **MinMax Method**: \
   - For Long Position: The SL is determined based on the minimum of low candles within the lookback period ( lookback is a parameter). \
   - For Short Position: The SL is calculated using the maximum of high candles within the specified lookback period. \
3. **ATR Method**: \
   - For Long Position: The SL is placed below the current price by a factor of the Average True Range (ATR) coefficient multiplied by the ATR value. \
   - For Short Position: The SL is positioned above the current price by the ATR coefficient times the ATR value. \
4. **DVWAP Band Method**: \
   - For Long Position: If the price falls within a daily VWAP band (e.g., band 3), the stop-loss (SL) is positioned at the bottom of the previous daily VWAP level (bottom of band 2). \
   - For Short Position: If the price falls within a daily VWAP band (e.g., band 2), the stop-loss (SL) is positioned at the topof the next daily VWAP level (top of band 3). \
5. **WVWAP Band Method**: \
   - For Long Position: Similar to DVWAP, the SL is set at the bottom of the previous weekly VWAP level. \
   - For Short Position: The SL is positioned at the top of the next weekly VWAP level. \
6. **Zigzag Method**: \
   - For Long Position: The SL is calculated based on the average length of legs from the Zigzag indicator, below the current price. \
   - For Short Position: The SL is set above the current price using the average Zigzag length. \
7. **Level Method**: \
   - For Long Position: SL levels are determined based on important price levels and support/resistance levels below the current price. \
   - For Short Position: The SL is set using significant levels and support/resistance levels above the current price. \
    Note: levels for this method are: \
VP_POC, VP_VAL, VP_VAH, Overnight_high, Overnight_low, Overnight_mid, initial_balance_high, initial_balance_low, initial_balance_mid, prev_session_max, prev_session_min, prev_session_mid,  daily VWAP levels, weekly VWAP levels, and support/resistance levels from hourly, daily, and weekly timeframes. \
Returns a dictionary same as this: \
{'sl': [17542.5], 'risk': [268.5], 'info': ['calculated based on maximum high price of previous 100 candles']} \
which includes sl value, risk on the trade and an information. \

more than one stoploss and the values type in the output can be a list such as this \

The take profit function takes into account the position type (long or short), symbol name (asset), and stop-loss (SL) value as inputs.

For short positions, the function identifies levels below the current price that meet the same criteria.

VP_POC, VP_VAL, VP_VAH, Overnight_high, Overnight_low, Overnight_mid, initial_balance_high, initial_balance_low, initial_balance_mid, prev_session_max, prev_session_min, prev_session_mid, daily VWAP levels, weekly VWAP levels, and support/resistance levels from hourly, daily, and weekly timeframes.
